      "summary": "An alleged living dinosaur from the Congo Basin, described as sauropod-like with a long neck and elephant-sized body. The name means 'one who stops the flow of rivers' in the Lingala language.",
      "full": "Mokele-mbembe is a legendary creature reported to inhabit the Congo River Basin, particularly the Lake Télé region of the Republic of Congo and Cameroon. Described as resembling a sauropod dinosaur with a long neck, small head, and elephant-sized semi-aquatic body, it has been the subject of numerous expeditions since the 1980s. The name means 'one who stops the flow of rivers' in the Lingala language. Local traditions among Likouala region tribes include reports of encounters with the creature. Multiple expeditions have been mounted by researchers including Roy Mackal (1980s) and William Gibbons, though none have produced conclusive evidence. Theories range from surviving sauropod dinosaurs to misidentified known animals such as swimming elephants or rhinoceroses, to pure folklore or hoaxes. The scientific consensus is that no credible evidence exists and surviving dinosaurs are extremely unlikely given the lack of supporting ecosystem and fossil record."
